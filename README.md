# Sound Record and AI Transcribe
It is workable in .venv environment.

## Packages you have to install
1. pyaudio (for recording)
   
   https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/
   
3. keyboard (for key space pressing)
   
   https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/
   
4. openai-whisper (for transcribing sound to text)

   Please check the github. There are additional and essential applications you have to install.

## Some problem I met
1. scoop is gone (I use scoop to install ffmpeg, which is necessary for openai-whisper.)

    Ans: Chat-GPT can help you

2. don't forget to install the package in the workplace environment.
3. If you use VS code and its virtual environment, you can choose the environment from the sidebar.

   By this, you don't need to build and download the packages each time you want to rrun the codes.
