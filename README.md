## beore you use
1. set the workplace enviroment and make sure all the aforementioned packages installed.
2. build the repository for the storage of records.
3. start to use it.
   
## Some problem I met
1. scoop is gone (I use scoop to install ffmpeg, which is necessary for openai-whisper.)

    Ans: Chat-GPT can help you

2. don't forget to install the package in the workplace environment.
3. If you use VS code, you can choose the previous workplacce environment from the sidebar.

   By this, you don't need to build and download the packages every time you want to execute these codes.
